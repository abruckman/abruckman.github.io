<h1>Gear Types</h1>
<section>
<p>Gear type refers to the way the boats catch the fish and prepare them for market.</p>
</section>
<ul>
	<li>Trawl Processor- This boat catches fish by trawl, which involves dragging massive nets along the bottom of the ocean, catching tons of fish at a time. Processor means that they boat freezes the fish for market onboard, meaning the boat can stay out for a longer time.</li>
	<li>Longliner- This boat catches fish by a "long line" (boat speak for rope) on the ground, often miles long. Every few feet along the line there is a string about a yard long with a hook on it. This allows the boat to deploy hundreds or even thousands of hooks at once, and then reel them all in at once. This is a slower way of fishing, but produces higher quality product and is far less environmentally impactful. Because it takes longer to fill the boat, most of the Longliners out of Dutch Harbor and Processors. Sometimes these boats are out for months at a time.</li>
	<li>Catcher boat- This is a trawler that doesn't freeze its own fish. These boats instead store the fish in Refrigerated Salt Water (RSW) tanks, wich keep them good for only a few days. The fish must be delivered to a plant, where they are frozen and delivered to market.</li>
</ul>
