<h1>The Life of a Fisheries Observer</h1>
<h2>What is a Fisheries Observer?</h2>
<p>A fisheries observer is a scientist or surveyor contracted by a fisheries regulator to monitor the activity of a fishing vessel. An observer's work varies from taking catch data, to recording mammal sitings and much more. </p>
<p>As an observer, you are both the scientific community and the federal government's <strong>man on the ground</strong> for better or worse.</p>

<h2>Where did you work?</h2>

<p>I worked on boats out of Dutch Harbor, Alaska. If you look at the aleutian Island chain, Dutch Harbor is on Unalaska, the 4th or so big island out. </p>

<p>I worked on all sorts of boats,catching all kinds of fish, with crews ranging from 4 to more than one hundred. The Defender (above), had a crew of 32.</p>

<p>Here is <a href=http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/observer-home/> NOAA's website</a> about being a fisheries observer. It's good because it has a lot of valuable links and information about fisheries management and being and observer. A lot of the links are in dropdown menus, which can make the site hard to navigate the first few times, but if you are familiar with it can be helpful.</p>
