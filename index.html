<h1>The Life of a Fisheries Observer</h1>
<h2>What is a Fisheries Observer?</h2>
<p>A fisheries observer is a scientist or surveyor contracted by a fisheries regulator to monitor the activity of a fishing vessel. An observer's work varies from taking catch data, to recording mammal sitings and much more. </p>
<p>As an observer, you are both the scientific community and the federal government's <strong>man on the ground</strong> for better or worse.</p>

<h2>Where did you work?</h2>

<p>I worked on boats out of Dutch Harbor, Alaska. If you look at the aleutian Island chain, Dutch Harbor is on Unalaska, the 4th or so big island out. </p>
